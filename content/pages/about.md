Title: About

# Who is this guy anyway?
I'm Mike! I'm a Southern California native and passionate machine learning researcher.

# So what's he all about?
I'm a CS grad student with a focus on ML and neural computation. My current
research interest lies at the intersection of deep neural
networks, variational bayesian inference and information theory. My work incorporates an
interdisciplinary perspective drawing from expertise in biological intelligence,
cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

# OK, so why should I care?
Because AI is cool dummy! In all seriousness, I believe not only in the 
technological value of my work; I view it as a fundamentally 
existential exercise: through investigation of human biological intelligence,
and the development of learning systems that mimic cognition,
we come to a more rigorous understanding of ourselves.
