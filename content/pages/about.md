In machine learning research we often spend quite a bit of time reviewing literature, working through derivations and attempting to reproduce others' scientific results. At some point I realized that I was producing quite a bit of (semi) polished work that was either 1.) not comprehensive enough to write a tutorial or 2.) not novel enough to publish. Much of the content here will be in the form of research notes where I grapple with the many perils, joys and frustrations of ML, RL & AI research. Hopefully you may find some of it useful! (keep in mind some of these are raw-form & likely contain errors).

At work I'm most interested by problems and ideas at the intersection of reinforcement learning, human-autonomy teaming and multi-agent autonomous systems. In my personal life I'm usually hiking, reading or drinking beer üçª
